# Rotating Potluck Randomizer

Do you have a rotating potluck? Does your church also use [Planning Center](https://www.planningcenter.com/)? Then do I have a somewhat ok tool for you.

Introducing...well...you already saw the name. It's a potluck randomizer. It will save your organizer minutes of their time.
